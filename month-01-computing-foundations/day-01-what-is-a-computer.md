What is a computer? A computer is a machine that executes instructions on data in a precise and deterministic way.

What is a CPU? Central Processing Unit: this is the component of the computer that fetches, decodes, and executes instructions from programs stored in memory.

What is memory? This is a temporary workspace where data and instructions live while the program is running

What is a program? A program is a precise list of instructions for the CPU.

What is Programing? This is the art of breaking human intentions into tiny exact steps a machine can execute.

Why programming is hard for human: Programming is hard because humans think in goals and outcomes, while computers only understand exact steps. This means humans must break complex ideas into precise instructions, which is mentally demanding.
