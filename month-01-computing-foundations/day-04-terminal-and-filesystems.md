What is a filesystem? A filesystem is a structured way for the operating system to store, organize, and retrieve data on disk.

What is a file vs a folder?  A file is a single unit of digital data (document, image, song) identified by a name and extension (e.g., .docx, .jpg), while a folder (or directory) is a container used to organize multiple files and other folders. Files hold content and have size, whereas folders structure data but do not contain data themselves. 

What is the terminal? The terminal is a text-based interface that allows users to interact directly with the operating system by issuing commands instead of using a graphical interface.

Why do developers prefer the terminal? Engineers prefer the terminal because it enables exact control, reproducibility, automation through scripts, and low-level debugging that does not depend on changing tools or frameworks.


How will this matter for deploying your SaaS? SaaS systems are deployed and managed on remote servers that are accessed through the terminal. Tasks like inspecting logs, running migrations, restarting services, and debugging production issues all rely on terminal usage.
