Step 2: Write Thoughtfully (No Rushing)

Answer in your own words:

What is programming (without mentioning any language)? Programming is the process of designing precise instructions that a machine can execute.

Why do computers need precise instructions? A computer has no understanding, intuition, or context. It only executes instructions in the exact order they are given.

What is logic in programming? Logic refers to the decisions, conditions, and order in which instructions are executed. It defines how a program behaves in different situations, independent of any programming language or syntax.


Why is syntax less important than thinking? Syntax is the grammar used to write instructions, while logic defines what those instructions mean. Memorizing syntax without understanding logic leads to fragile programs that are hard to debug.


Give a real example from your construction SaaS where ambiguity would cause a bug. An example of ambiguity is the rule “assign a staff member to a project.” If this rule is not precisely defined, the system may allow assigning a staff member who belongs to a different company, is inactive, or is already assigned to another project at the same time. This ambiguity could result in one company seeing or affecting another company’s data, incorrect project staffing, or billing errors. The bug happens because the system was not given exact rules for who can be assigned, under what conditions, and what should happen when those conditions are not met.
